[Well, it was fun while it lasted. Unfortunately, it looks like thesimple.com has chosen to turn all of these units into e-waste despite their supposed commitment to the environment.](https://github.com/lsellens/thesimple-thermostat/blob/master/Simple_Thermostat_End_of_Service_12-31-2025.png)

This integration is for users of Simple WiFi thermostat made by "[TheSimple](https://thesimple.com/)" which is accessed through [ecofactor.com](https://www.ecofactor.com).
